ARTICLE 1.1 RECOGNITION  
Management hereby recognizes the Engineers and Architects Association (EAA), as the  exclusive representative of the employees in the Administrative Unit, for which EAA was  certified as the majority representative by the Employee Relations Board on  June 17, 1980.

This Memorandum of Understanding (hereinafter referred to as MOU) is entered into on  between the City Administrative Officer (CAO) as the authorized management  representative of the City and the authorized management representatives of any City  Department in which classifications listed in the Appendices may be employed  (hereinafter referred to as Management) and authorized representatives of the Engineers  and Architects Association (EAA or Association) as the exclusive recognized employee  organization for the Administrative Unit (Unit).

Management and the Association acknowledge that during the meet and confer process,  each had the unlimited right and the opportunity to make demands and proposals on any  subject within the scope of representation and that this MOU constitutes the full and entire  understanding of the parties regarding all such demands and proposals. The parties  mutually understand that any prior or existing understandings or agreements by the  parties, whether formal or informal, are hereby superseded or terminated. 
1  
MOU01-22  
The parties mutually agree that this MOU may not be opened at any time during its term  for any reason, except where noted herein or by mutual consent of the parties hereto.  
It is mutually understood that any changes mutually agreed to shall not be binding upon  the parties unless and until they have been implemented in accordance with Article 1.3.  
The waiver or breach of any term or condition of this MOU by any party hereto, shall not  constitute a precedent in the future enforcement of any of its terms and provisions.  
ARTICLE 1.5 TERM  
The term of this MOU shall commence on the date when the terms and conditions for its  effectiveness, as set forth in Article 1.3, Implementation of Memorandum of  Understanding, are fully met, but in no event shall said MOU become effective prior to the  date of adoption by the City Council. This MOU shall expire and otherwise be fully  terminated at 11:59 P.M. on June 30, 2022.

ARTICLE 1.7 OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT  
During the period of time the proposed MOU is being considered by the Mayor, City  Council, or Council Committees, neither the Association nor Management, nor their  authorized representatives, will appear before the Mayor, City Council, or Council  Committees nor meet with the Mayor or the members of the City Council individually to  advocate any addition or deletion to the terms and conditions of this MOU. However, this  Article shall not preclude the parties from appearing before the Mayor, City Council, or  Council Committees nor meeting with the Mayor or individual members of the City Council  to advocate or urge the adoption of this MOU.  
ARTICLE 1.8 SAVINGS CLAUSE  
If any term or provision of this MOU is found to be in conflict with any City, State or Federal  law, the parties agree to meet promptly, and as often as necessary, to expeditiously  renegotiate this term or provision.  
All other terms and provisions of this MOU shall remain in full force and effect during the  period of such renegotiations and thereafter until their normal expiration date. 
2  
MOU01-22  
The parties understand that many of the employees covered by this MOU may also be  covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, 29 U.S.C. Section 210 et  seq. (FLSA). To the extent that any provision herein conflicts with the FLSA, employees  covered by the FLSA shall receive required benefits and any additional benefits set forth  herein if compatible with the FLSA.  
ARTICLE 1.9 MANAGEMENT RIGHTS  
As the responsibility for the management of the City and direction of its work force is  vested exclusively in its City officials and department heads whose powers and duties are  specified by law, it is mutually understood that except as specifically set forth herein no  provisions in this MOU shall be deemed to limit or curtail the City officials and department  heads in any way in the exercise of the rights, powers and authority which they had prior  to the effective date of this MOU. The Association recognizes that these rights, powers,  and authority include but are not limited to, the right to determine the mission of its  constituent departments, offices and boards, set standards of services to be offered to  the public, exercise control and discretion over the City's organization and operations,  take disciplinary action for proper cause, relieve City employees from duty because of  lack of work, lack of funds or other legitimate reasons, determine the methods, means  and personnel by which the City's operations are to be conducted, take all necessary  actions to maintain uninterrupted service to the community and carry out its mission in  emergencies; provided, however, that the exercise of these rights does not preclude  employees and their representatives from consulting or raising grievances about the  practical consequences that decisions on these matters may have on wages, hours, and  other terms and conditions of employment.  
ARTICLE 1.10 CITY - ASSOCIATION RELATIONSHIP  
A. Continuity of Service to the Public  
The City of Los Angeles is engaged in public services requiring continuous  operations that are necessary to maintain the health and safety of all citizens. The  obligation to maintain these public services is imposed both upon the City and the  Association during the term of this MOU and the certification of the Association as  the exclusive representative of the employees in this Unit.  
B. Mutual Pledge of Accord  
Inherent in the relationship between the City and its employees is the obligation of  the City to deal justly and fairly with its employees and of the employees to  cooperate with their fellow employees and the City in the performance of their  public service obligation.  
It is the purpose of this MOU to promote and ensure harmonious relations,  cooperation and understanding between the City and the employees represented 
3  
MOU01-22  
by the Association and to establish and maintain proper standards of wages, hours  and other terms or conditions of employment.  
C. No Strike - No Lockout  
In consideration of the mutual desire of the parties to promote and ensure  harmonious relations and in consideration of the Mutual Pledge of Accord, the City  agrees that there shall be no lockout or the equivalent of members of the  Association, and the Association and its members agree that there shall be no  strike or other concerted action resulting in the withholding of service by the  members during the term of this MOU. Should such a strike or concerted action by  Association members occur, the Association shall immediately instruct its  members to return to work. It is mutually understood and agreed that the City has  the absolute right to impose discipline and, in that regard, shall have the right to  take disciplinary action, including discharge, against any employee who  participates in any manner in any strike or slowdown, withholding of services,  picketing in support of a strike, or other concerted action. The curtailing of  operations by the City in whole or part for operational or economic reasons shall  not be construed as a lockout.  
The provisions of this Paragraph C shall not detract in any way from any  restrictions imposed by law on strikes and other types of work stoppage by public  employees.  
ARTICLE 1.11 RELEASE TIME FROM CITY SERVICE TO WORK FOR THE  ASSOCIATION  
The appointing authority of any City department may grant to elected officers or appointed  representatives of the EAA time off for employee organization representation activities in  that Department. No more than one employee in a Department or Bureau of the  Department Public Works, and no more than four employees for all EAA bargaining units,  shall be allowed release time under this Article.

B. The employee shall be paid their current salary by the City while they are  performing these duties for EAA.

D. The EAA shall reimburse the City for all documented actual salary and benefits  costs incurred as a result of release time, including but not limited to, vacation, sick  leave, compensated time off, retirement, short-term disability, life insurance, 
4  
MOU01-22  
medical, dental, and workers’ compensation. The benefits costs shall be based on  the benefits rates established by the CAO as contained in the City Budget in effect  during the period of release time, and the cost of other benefits recommended by  the Joint Labor Management Benefits Committee and approved by the City Council  that become effective during this period.  
E. Payment of any overtime worked while on release time shall be the responsibility  of the EAA.  
F. The City shall invoice EAA for reimbursement on a quarterly basis and EAA shall  make quarterly payments to the Controller of all reimbursable costs identified in  Section D above.  
G. Employees on release time shall submit weekly time sheets (signed by the  employee and the EAA Executive Director or their designee) to their respective  Departmental Personnel Officer specifying the number of hours worked, and use  of any sick leave, vacation time or compensated time off.  
H. Should an employee incur a work-related injury while on release time, they shall  remain on release time with the EAA during the period of injury-on-duty (IOD), or  until the release time has ended, and shall continue to be counted in determining  the four employee maximum, as provided for above.  
I. When the employee returns from release time, they shall return to their civil service  classification and pay grade at the time of release.  
J. Release time shall be granted for a maximum of 12 months in any three year  period. Additional release time shall be permitted only with Management’s  approval. The three year period shall commence on the first day of authorized  release.  
K. The employee must have passed probation in their current class to be eligible for  release time.  
L. The EAA shall indemnify, defend and hold the City and its officers and employees  harmless against any and all claims, suits, demands or other forms of liability that  might arise out of or result from any action taken by an employee in the service of  the EAA.

ARTICLE 2.8 LEGISLATIVE CHECK – OFF  
During the term of this MOU, a payroll deduction will be established by the Association  for the purpose of allowing employees in this unit to contribute towards the Association's  federal legislative activities.  
Said contributions shall be deducted by the Controller from 24 biweekly payroll checks of  each employee in this Unit who voluntarily consents to said contribution by submitting a  payroll deduction card signed by the individual employee. Remittance of the amount of  said deductions shall be sent to the Association by the Controller within 30 working days  after the conclusion of the month in which said deductions were withheld.  
A fee of nine cents ($.09) per deduction shall be assessed by the Controller for the  processing of each payroll deduction taken. The Controller will deduct the aggregate  amount of said fees on a biweekly basis. Contributions shall be made payable as directed  by the Association to the Federal Legislative Action Committee of the Association.  
It is agreed that neither any employee nor the Association shall have any claim against  the City for any deductions made or not made, as the case may be, unless a claim of  error is made in writing to the Controller within 30 calendar days after the date such  deductions were or should have been made.  
ARTICLE 2.9 PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS AND DUES  
The following provisions shall apply to employees in classifications listed in the  Appendices herein.  
A. DUES  
1. a. Payroll deductions as may be properly requested and lawfully  permitted will be deducted by the Controller biweekly, in twenty-four  (24) increments annually from the salary of each employee in the unit 
9  
MOU01-22  
where the Union identifies in writing to the Controller those  individuals from whom union-related deduction(s) should be lawfully  taken.  
Said payroll deductions shall not be assessed in any biweekly pay  period in which the affected employee is not paid a minimum of  twenty (20) hours. Such amounts shall be determined by the Union  and implemented by Management in the first payroll period which 
starts thirty (30) calendar days after written notice of the new amount  from the Union is received by the Controller.  
b. Employees who are members of the Union who previously elected  to make union membership deductions prior to (1) starting an unpaid  leave of absence, or (2) otherwise going on inactive status due to  lack of scheduled hours, shall be reinstated as Union members with  the automatic voluntary dues deduction immediately upon their  return to work.  
2. Notwithstanding any provisions of LAAC Section 4.203 to the contrary,  during the term of this MOU, payroll deductions requested by employees in  this Unit for the purpose of becoming a member and/or to obtain benefits  offered by any qualified organization other than the Union will not be  accepted by the Controller. For the purpose of this provision, qualified  organization means any organization of employees whose responsibility or  goal is to represent employees in the City's meet and confer process.  
3. Any employees in this Unit who have authorized Union dues deductions  with the Union on the effective date of this MOU or at any time subsequent  to the effective date of this MOU shall continue to have such dues  deductions made by the City during the term of this MOU. Under current  California law, the City has no input or control over the procedure for  termination of union dues taken as payroll deductions from employees  subject to this MOU, nor any legal ability to stop such deductions without  the specific authorization of the Union. All procedures for termination of  dues deductions outlined in this subsection are, therefore, the Union’s  statement of its unilateral dues termination procedures; the City’s sole  obligation is to process such dues cancellations received from the Union  pursuant to this subsection, subject to any future court decisions applicable  to dues termination procedures. Any employee in the Unit may terminate  such Union dues during the first full payroll period that begins the period  commencing ninety (90) days before the employee’s anniversary date in the  final year of the MOU or as disseminated by the Union by notifying the Union  of his/her termination of Union dues deduction. Such notification shall be in  the form of a letter containing the following information: employee name,  employee number, job classification, department name, and name of the  Union from which dues deductions are to be cancelled. The Union will 
10  
MOU01-22  
provide to the City the appropriate documentation to process these  membership dues cancellations within ten (10) business days after the  close of the withdrawal period. Employees with any questions relating to  union membership dues shall direct those questions to the Union.  
B. MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
1. The Controller shall cause the amount of the dues or other proper  deductions to be deducted from twenty-four (24) biweekly payroll checks of  each employee in this Unit as specified by Union under the terms contained  herein. "Dues," shall be the result of Union certification that it has and will  maintain an authorization signed by the individual employee from whose  salary or wages the deductions are to be made, provided in the form of a  list by the Union to the City.  
a. Remittance of the aggregate amount of all dues and other proper  deductions made from the salaries of employees hereunder shall be  made to the Union by the Controller within thirty (30) working days  after the conclusion of the month in which said dues, and/or  deductions were deducted.  
b. A fee of nine cents ($.09) per deduction shall be assessed by the  Controller for the processing of each payroll deduction taken. The  Controller will deduct the aggregate amount of said fees on a  biweekly basis.  
2. The Controller shall also apply this provision to every permanent employee  who, following the operative date of this Article, becomes a member of this  Unit, within sixty (60) calendar days of such reassignment or transfer.  
3. Management will provide the Union with unit membership information  pursuant to the Unit Membership List Article of this MOU.  
4. The Controller shall notify the Union within sixty (60) calendar days of any  employee who, because of a change in employment status, is no longer a  member of the Unit or subject to the provisions of this Article.  
C. UNION RESPONSIBILITIES  
Except for claims resulting from errors caused by defective City equipment, the  Union agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the City for any loss or damage  arising from the operation of this Article.  
 
11  
MOU01-22  
D. CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION 1159 (a-b)  
Existing California Government Code Section 1159 (a-b) states:  
“(a) The Controller, a public employer, an employee organization, or any of their  employees or agents, shall not be liable for, and shall have a complete defense to,  any claims or actions under the law of this state for requiring, deducting, receiving,  or retaining agency or fair share fees from public employees, and current or former  public employees shall not have standing to pursue these claims or actions, if the  fees were permitted at the time under the laws of this state then in force and paid,  through payroll deduction or otherwise, prior to June 27, 2018.”  
“(b) This section shall apply to claims and actions pending on its effective date, as  well as to claims and actions filed on or after that date.”  
ARTICLE 2.10 NON-DISCRIMINATION  
The parties mutually reaffirm their respective policies of non-discrimination in the  treatment of any employee because of race, ethnicity, color, religion, creed, gender  (including pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, or medical conditions related to these  areas), gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, LGBTQ+ identity, marital  status, age (40 and over), actual or perceived disability (mental and physical) including  HIV and AIDS, medical condition (cancer and genetic characteristics), genetic  information, national origin (including language use restrictions), ancestry, political  activities or political affiliation, military and veteran status, or by denying Family and  Medical Leave Care or by engaging in retaliation for having filed a discrimination  complaint, for participating in a discrimination investigation or for opposing discrimination.  
Management and the Association agree that no employee shall be interfered with,  intimidated, restrained, coerced or discriminated against because of Association activity  and/or the exercise of any employee rights granted pursuant to LAAC Sections 4.845  and/or 4.857 (Employee Relations Ordinance).

ARTICLE 3.0 GRIEVANCES  
ARTICLE 3.1 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE  
STATEMENT OF INTENT  
Management and the Association have a mutual interest in resolving workplace issues  appropriately, expeditiously and at the lowest level possible. In recognition of this mutual  interest, the parties acknowledge that the grievance process is not a replacement for daily  communication between the employee and the supervisor, nor is it inherently an  adversarial process. Rather, it is a process to mutually resolve workplace issues to the  maximum extent possible within the organization.  
Section I - Definitions  
A. Grievance  
A grievance is defined as a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of  this written MOU, or departmental rules and regulations governing personnel  practices or working conditions applicable to employees covered by this MOU. The  parties agree that the following shall not be subject to the grievance procedure:  
1. An impasse in meeting and conferring upon the terms of a proposed MOU.  
2. Any matter for which an administrative remedy is provided before the Civil  Service Commission.  
3. Any issue that the parties agree to refer to another administrative resolution  process.  
B. Employee Comment Sheet (Comment Card) – LAPD  
Employee Comment Sheets (Comment Cards) are used to document positive and  negative conduct or incidents. Employee Comment Sheets (Comment Cards) are  not considered disciplinary in nature and shall not be considered as an offense in 
13  
MOU01-22  
the progressive discipline process. It is mutually agreed that in the Los Angeles  Police Department an “Employee Comment Sheet” (Comment Card) is not  grievable or arbitrable. An employee may use an Employee’s Report, Form 15.7,  to make a written response to the Employee Comment Sheet (Comment Card)  within 30 days after it is served.  
Section II - Responsibilities and Rights  
A. Nothing in this grievance procedure shall be construed to apply to matters for  which an administrative remedy is provided before the Civil Service Commission.  Where a matter within the scope of this grievance procedure is alleged to be both  a grievance and an unfair labor practice under the jurisdiction of the ERB, the  employee may elect to pursue the matter under either the grievance procedure  herein provided, or by action before the ERB. The employee's election of either  procedure shall constitute a binding election of the remedy chosen and a waiver  of the alternative remedy.  
B. No grievant shall lose the right to process a grievance because of Management  imposed limitations in scheduling meetings.  
C. The grievant has the responsibility to discuss the grievance informally with the  immediate supervisor. The immediate supervisor will, upon request of a grievant,  discuss the grievance with the employee at a mutually satisfactory time. The  grievant may be represented by a representative of the grievant’s choice in the  informal discussion with the immediate supervisor and in all formal review levels  and in arbitration. When more than one employee in a department is aggrieved,  and the facts and issues of the alleged grievance are the same, and if affected  employees agree to waive their right to discuss the grievance with their immediate  supervisor, a single immediate supervisor will be designated by department  Management to discuss the grievance at the informal level with affected  employees designated to represent the grievance and the employees’  representative. Such grievance will be processed as a single grievance through all  formal levels of review. All affected employees involved in the action must waive  their respective rights to file an individual grievance on the same issue and to  discuss the grievance at the informal level with the respective immediate  supervisors on a form provided by Management prior to the discussion with the  designated supervisor.  
In instances where more than one employee in a department is aggrieved, the  Association may elect to file the grievance on behalf of the employees. The facts  and issues of the alleged grievance must be the same. Such grievance must  contain the names of all grievants and the specific facts pertaining to each grievant.  At the time of filing the grievance, the Association may request that the first level  of review be at a level higher than Step 1 and shall provide justification for such  request. A single supervisor will be designated by department Management to  discuss the grievance at each level with one affected employee designated to 
14  
MOU01-22  
represent the grievance and the Association. Such grievance will be processed as  a single grievance through all formal levels of review. All affected employees  involved in the action must waive their respective rights to file an individual  grievance on the same issue and to discuss the grievance at the informal level with  their respective immediate supervisors on a form provided by Management prior  to the discussion with the designated supervisor. Such form shall also include a  statement that the employee understands that they are party to a grievance filed  by the Association.  
D. The time limits between steps of the grievance procedure provided herein may be  extended by mutual agreement; or, the grievant and Management may waive one  or more levels of review from this grievance procedure.  
E. Management shall notify the Association of any formal grievance filed that involves  the interpretation and/or application of the provisions of this MOU, and a paid  Association Staff Representative shall have the right to be present and participate  in the discussion at any formal grievance meeting concerning such a grievance.  The paid Association Staff Representative who elects to attend the grievance  meeting shall notify the head of the department, office or bureau.  
The Association is to be notified of the resolution of all other formal grievances.  Section III - Procedure  
GENERAL PROVISIONS  
A. BINDING ELECTION OF PROCEDURE  
Where a matter within the scope of this grievance procedure is alleged to be both  a grievance and an unfair labor practice under the jurisdiction of the ERB, the  employee must elect to pursue the matter under either the grievance procedure  herein provided, or by action before the ERB. The employee’s election of either  procedure shall constitute a binding election of the procedure chosen and a waiver  of the alternate procedure.  
B. GRIEVANCE PROCESS RIGHTS  
No grievant shall lose their right to process their grievance because of  Management-imposed limitations in scheduling meetings.  
C. TIME, TIME LIMITS AND WAIVERS  
“Business days” shall be defined as Monday thru Friday, exclusive of City Holidays,  as defined in Article 7.5 of this MOU. 
15  
MOU01-22  
The time limits between steps of the grievance procedure provided herein may be  extended by mutual agreement, not to exceed 60 business days. In addition, the  grievant and Management may jointly waive one level of review from this grievance  procedure.  
D. MEDIATION  
At any step following the Informal Discussion in the grievance process, the  Association or Management may request mediation, by letter to the department’s  personnel officer or the Association. Within 10 business days of receipt of a  request for mediation, the receiving party shall either return the request without  action or request that the ERB appoint a mediator. The ERB shall attempt to obtain  the services of a mediator from the State Mediation and Conciliation Service. If a  State mediator is unavailable, the Association and Management may jointly agree  to a mediator selected by the Executive Director of the ERB. The fees of such  mediator shall be shared equally by the Association and Management.  
The primary effort of the mediator shall be to assist the parties in settling the  grievance in a mutually satisfactory fashion. The mediation procedure shall be  informal, i.e., court reporters shall not be allowed, the rules of evidence shall not  apply, and no formal record shall be made. The mediator shall determine whether  witnesses are necessary in the conduct of the proceedings.  
If settlement is not possible, the mediator may be requested to provide the parties  with an immediate oral opinion as to how the grievance would be decided if it went  to arbitration. Such opinion shall be advisory only. Upon mutual agreement of the  parties, the mediator may be requested to furnish such opinion in writing, along  with a brief statement of the reasons for the opinion. Such opinion shall not be  used during any subsequent arbitration.  
Notwithstanding the above, and LAAC Section 4.865, the parties may mutually  agree to accept the opinion of the mediator as binding.  
If mediation does not resolve the issue, the grievant has 10 business days to file  an appeal to the next level in the procedure.  
E. EXPEDITED ISSUES  
To resolve issues at the appropriate level, the following issues will be automatically  waived to the General Manager level of the grievance process.  
∙ Suspensions without pay  
∙ Allegations of failure to accommodate medical restrictions  
∙ Allegations of retaliation  
∙ Whistleblower complaints 
16  
MOU01-22  
Additional issues may be waived to the General Manager level upon mutual  agreement of the Association and Management.  
GRIEVANCE PROCESS  
STEP 1 - ISSUE IDENTIFICATION AND INFORMAL DISCUSSION  
The employee shall discuss the issue with the immediate supervisor on an informal basis  to identify and attempt resolution of the employee’s issue within 10 business days  following the day the issue arose. The employee shall have the affirmative responsibility  to inform the supervisor that the issue is being raised pursuant to this grievance  procedure.  
The immediate supervisor shall meet with the employee, secure clarification of the issue,  consider the employee’s proposed solution, and discuss possible alternative solutions  and/or other administrative remedies. The immediate supervisor shall inform the  department’s personnel office, and the personnel director shall inform the Association of  the grievance. The immediate supervisor shall respond verbally within 10 business days  following the meeting with the employee. Failure of the supervisor to respond within the  time limit shall entitle the employee to process the issue to the next step.  
STEP 2  
If the issue is not resolved at Step 1, or jointly referred to another administrative procedure  for resolution, the employee may, within 10 business days of receiving the response from  the immediate supervisor, serve a grievance initiation form with the immediate supervisor  (or another member of management if the immediate supervisor is not available within  the ten day filing period), who will accept it on behalf of management and immediately  forward it to the next level manager above the immediate supervisor who is not in the  same bargaining unit as the employee.  
The manager, or appropriate designee, shall meet with the employee within 10 business  days of the date of service of the grievance form at this Step to discuss the facts and  solicit information on possible solutions or other appropriate administrative procedures.  The manager will provide a written response to the employee within 10 business days of  meeting with the employee. Failure of management to respond within the time limit shall  entitle the grievant to process the grievance to the next step.  
STEP 3  
If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2, the employee may serve a written appeal to the  General Manager, or designee, within 10 business days following (a) receipt of the written  response at Step 2, or (b) the last day of the response period provided for in Step 2. The  General Manager or designee shall meet with the employee within 10 business days of  the date of service of the appeal, discuss the facts, and solicit information on possible 
17  
MOU01-22  
alternative solutions. A written response will be provided to the employee within 20  business days from the date of meeting with the employee.  
Los Angeles Police Department only:  
If the grievance is not resolved at Step 2, the employee may serve a written appeal with  the Chief of Police. If the Chief of Police, or designee, fails to respond within 10 business  days, the grievant may process the grievance to the next level. The employee may serve  written notice of the grievance to the Police Commission, or designee, within 10 business  days following (a) receipt of the written response at Step 3, or (b) the last day of the  response period provided for in Step 3. Failure of the grievant to serve such notice upon  the Chief of Police shall constitute a waiver of the grievance. The grievance shall be heard  by the Commission, or designee, within 10 business days of the receipt of the appeal,  and a written decision shall be rendered within 30 business days from the date of meeting  with the employee.  
STEP 4 - ARBITRATION  
If the written response at Step 3, or mediation, does not settle the grievance, or  Management fails to provide a written response within 30 business days of the Step 3  meeting (in the Police Department, the Step 3 meeting includes Chief of Police and Police  Commission levels of review), the Association may elect to serve a written request for  arbitration with the ERB. A copy of this notice shall be served upon the department’s  personnel officer. The request for arbitration must be filed with the ERB within 20 business  days following (a) the date of service of the written response of the General  Manager/Commission or the designee, or (b) the last day of the response period provided  for in Step 3. Failure of the Association to serve a written request for arbitration with the  ERB within said period shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.  
If such written notice is served, the parties shall jointly select an arbitrator from a list of  seven arbitrators furnished by the ERB, within 10 business days following receipt of said  list. Failure of the Association to notify the ERB of the selected arbitrator within 60  business days of receipt of said list shall constitute a waiver of the grievance.  
A. Arbitration of a grievance hereunder shall be limited to the formal grievance as  originally filed by the employee to the extent that said grievance has not been  satisfactorily resolved. The proceedings shall be conducted in accordance with  applicable rules and procedures adopted or specified by the ERB, unless the  parties hereto agree to other rules or procedures for the conduct of such  arbitration. The fees and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally by the  parties involved, it being mutually understood that all other expenses including, but  not limited to, fees for witnesses, transcripts, and similar costs incurred by the  parties during such arbitration, will be the responsibility of the individual party  incurring same. 
18  
MOU01-22  
B. The decision of an arbitrator resulting from any arbitration of a grievance hereunder  shall be binding upon the parties concerned.  
C. The decision of an arbitrator resulting from any arbitration of grievances hereunder  shall not add to, subtract from, or otherwise modify the terms and conditions of this  MOU.  
PROCEDURE FOR GRIEVANCES AFFECTING A GROUP OF EMPLOYEES  
The Association may elect to file a grievance on behalf of two or more employees  employed in the same department, office, or bureau. The facts and issues of the  grievance must be the same. In cases where the issues identified in the grievance affect  more employees than are identified as grievants, the parties may agree that the remedy  may be applied to those employees upon their consent, if needed.  
PROCEDURE:  
STEP 1  
The Association shall file the grievance in writing with the General Manager, or designee,  of the affected department within 20 business days following the day the issue arose. To  the extent possible, the filing shall include the issue of the grievance, proposed  solution(s), the names of the employees impacted by the issue, and the specific facts  pertaining to each grievant and completed waiver forms for each participating grievant  employed in that department, office, or bureau. All employees participating in the  grievance must waive their respective rights to file an individual grievance on the same  issue by completing an individual grievance waiver form which shall be included with the  group grievance submittal.  
The General Manager, or designee, shall provide written notification to the Employee  Relations Division of the CAO of the receipt of the grievance. The General Manager, or  designee, shall meet with no more than 2 grievants named in the group grievance and  the Association within 20 business days of receipt of the complete and proper group  grievance filing to review the facts, solicit information on the proposed solution(s), or  consider other appropriate administrative procedures. The General Manager, or  designee, may include department managers who have knowledge of the grievance  issues and/or representatives from the CAO’s Employee Relations Division in the meeting  with the Association. The General Manager, or designee, shall prepare a written response  within 20 business days of the meeting.  
Los Angeles Police Department only:  
STEP 1A  
If the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, or the Chief of Police, or designee, fails to  respond within the time limit, the Association may process the grievance to the next level. 
19  
MOU01-22  
The Association may serve written notice of the grievance to the Police Commission, or  designee, within 10 business days following (a) receipt of the written response at Step 1,  or (b) the last day of the response period provided for in Step 1. Failure of the Association  to serve such notice shall constitute a waiver of the grievance. The grievance shall be  heard by the Commission, or designee, within 10 business days of the receipt of the  appeal, and a written decision shall be rendered within 30 business days from the date of  meeting with the Association.  
STEP 2  
If the grievance is not settled at Step 1, or Step 1A in the Police Department, the  Association may file for arbitration pursuant to the procedure in Step 4 – Arbitration,  above.  
ARTICLE 3.2 GRIEVANCE REPRESENTATION  
The Association may designate a reasonable number of grievance representatives who  must be members of the Unit, and shall provide all departments, offices or bureaus with  a written list of employees who have been so designated. Management will semi-annually  accept changes to the list presented by the Association. A grievance representative, if so  requested, may represent a grievant at all levels of the grievance procedure.  
The grievant and the representative may have a reasonable amount of paid time off for  the purpose of presenting grievances. However, said representative will receive paid time  off only if a member of the Association; is in the same Unit as the grievant; is employed  by the same department, office or bureau as the grievant; and is employed within a  reasonable distance from the work location of the grievant.  
The grievant’s supervisor must concur regarding the necessary time off for presenting the  grievance at the appropriate level. The grievant shall notify the representative of the  meeting arrangements.  
If a grievance representative must leave the work location to represent a grievant,  permission shall first be obtained from the representative’s supervisor on a form provided  for such purpose. Permission to leave will be granted unless such absence would cause  an unreasonable interruption of work. If such permission cannot be granted promptly, the  grievance representative will be informed when time can be made available. Such time  will not be more than 48 hours, excluding scheduled days off and/or legal holidays, after  the time of the grievance representative's request unless otherwise mutually agreed to.  Denial of permission to leave at the time requested will, upon mutual agreement,  constitute an extension of time limits provided in the grievance procedure equal to the  amount of the delay.  
Time spent on grievances outside of regular working hours of the employee or the  representative shall not be counted as work time for any purpose. Whenever a grievance  is to be presented during the working hours of the grievant and/or the representative, only 
20  
MOU01-22  
that amount of time necessary to bring about a prompt disposition of the grievance will be  allowed.  
ARTICLE 3.3 GRIEVANCES REGARDING SUSPENSIONS  
Grievances involving suspensions of five days or less in the aggregate during a 12 month  period may be filed, by mutual agreement, at any Step of the Grievance Procedure, but  at no Step lower than Step 2.  
ARTICLE 4.0 ON THE JOB  
ARTICLE 4.1 SAFETY  
Section I  
Safety clothing and devices currently provided by Management shall continue to be  provided, as long as the need exists. The Association will encourage all Unit employees  to utilize said safety clothing and devices to the fullest extent possible.  
Section II  
Management will make every reasonable effort to provide safe working conditions. The  Association will encourage all Unit employees to perform their work in a safe manner.  Each employee should be alert to unsafe practices, equipment and conditions, and should  report any hazardous condition promptly to their immediate supervisor. Said Supervisor  should:  
A. Correct or eliminate the hazardous condition if correction or elimination thereof is  within the authority and capability of the supervisor; or,  
B. Safeguard a hazardous condition in such a manner as to preclude injury to  personnel and/or property damage, and promptly report the nature and location of  the hazardous condition to the next level of supervision designated by  departmental management for said purpose, if elimination of the hazardous  condition is not within the immediate supervisor's capability.  
C. If elimination of the hazardous condition is not within the capability of the second  level of supervision to correct, he/she shall promptly report the problem to the next  designated level of supervision or inform the Departmental Safety Coordinator  about the problem.  
Section III  
If the procedures for handling a reported hazardous condition are not initiated, or if  initiated, fail to affect a satisfactory solution of the problem within a reasonable time, the 
21  
MOU01-22  
employee or their representative may call the City Occupational Safety Office and report  such hazard.  
Unresolved complaints hereunder may be referred to the State Safety Engineer for  processing under the CAL/OSHA rules and regulations.  
ARTICLE 4.2 PERSONNEL FOLDERS  
An employee shall be entitled to review the contents of their departmental personnel  folder(s) at reasonable intervals, upon request, during hours when their personnel office  is normally open for business. Such review shall not interfere with the normal business of  the department, office or bureau.  
No evaluatory or disciplinary document may be placed in an employee's personnel file  without their review and a copy of the document presented to them for their records. The  employee shall acknowledge that they have reviewed and received a copy of the  document by signing it with the understanding that such signature does not necessarily  indicate agreement with its contents.  
A written reprimand or “Notice to Correct Deficiencies” will be sealed upon the written  request of an affected employee if he/she has not been involved in any subsequent  related incidents that resulted in written or higher corrective action for a period of three  years from the date the most recent notice was issued or Management action taken.  
Pursuant to the above paragraph, those documents, either removed from the personnel  file or sealed, shall be available upon subpoena or other appropriate legal request.  
ARTICLE 4.3 ACTING ASSIGNMENT PAY  
Section I - Definition  
It is the intent of Management to avoid working an employee in an out-of-class  assignment. An out-of-class assignment is defined as any assignment requiring  substantial work in a higher level position which is not usually included within the scope  of the duties and responsibilities as defined by the class specifications for the class to  which the assigned employee's regular position is allocated.  
Section II - Rate of Pay  
An employee temporarily assigned higher level duties will continue to receive the rate of  pay for their regular classification and pay grade. Upon completion of a qualifying period  of 10 consecutive working days on such assignment, such employee shall become  eligible for additional compensation. The higher compensation shall begin on the 11th  working day of the assignment and shall continue thereafter for each day that the  employee works in such assignment. Each such temporary assignment shall require 
22  
MOU01-22  
completion of a new qualifying period each fiscal year, except when such assignment is  either continuous or in the same City department, office or bureau.  
Whenever management assigns an employee on a temporary basis to perform the duties  of a vacant higher level position, such employee shall become eligible for additional  compensation on the first day of said assignment.  
The employee qualifying for additional compensation under this article shall receive  additional compensation in an amount equal to 5.5% of the employee’s base hourly rate.  Acting pay shall be treated as a non-pensionable “adds to pay” and paid for all qualifying  hours worked.  
Section III – Status Review  
Acting pay is not intended as compensation for a long-term out-of-class assignment and  shall not extend past one (1) year. When an employee has filled an acting assignment for  a period of 180 days, Management will review the status of the vacancy to determine  when the vacancy can be filled through appropriate measures. Upon request,  Management will review the acting assignment with the employee. At that time, the  employee may request to be removed from the acting assignment.  
ARTICLE 4.4 REST PERIODS  
Each employee shall be granted a minimum 15 minute rest period in each four hour  period; provided, however, that no such rest period shall be taken during the first or last  hour of any employee's working day nor in excess of 15 minutes without the express  consent of the designated supervisor.  
Management reserves the right to suspend the rest period or any portion thereof during  an emergency. Any rest period so suspended or not taken at the time permitted shall not  be accumulated or carried over from one day to any subsequent day, or compensated for  in any form.  
ARTICLE 4.5 RAIN GEAR  
Management will provide rain gear to employees in the classifications listed below who  are required to work outside in inclement weather as a normal part of their job duties.  Management shall replace such gear when no longer serviceable.

ARTICLE 4.6 UNIFORMS OR OTHER REQUIRED WORK CLOTHING  No such provisions are made for this MOU.  
ARTICLE 4.7 WORK BOOT ALLOWANCE  
Full time employees who are required and approved by management to wear a specific  safety-type work shoe/boot or a uniform shoe/boot and whose employing department  does not already provide said shoes or boots, or a purchase voucher, shall receive a  biweekly non-pensionable amount of $8.00 per pay period and intermittent and half-time  employees shall receive a biweekly non-pensionable amount of $4.00 per pay period for  the purchase, repair and maintenance of said shoes or boots.  
Each department shall develop safety shoe standards to include safety requirements,  style and color consistent with operating needs and reasonable uniformity. All employees,  including new hires and transfers, shall be responsible for compliance with these  standards. Failure to wear approved and serviceable safety shoes while on duty may  subject the employee to appropriate discipline.  
ARTICLE 4.8 TELECOMMUTING  
The EAA and Management acknowledge the City of Los Angeles Telecommuting  Program (C.F. #93-2250), and that employees of this Unit may be considered for eligibility  by Management of their respective departments/bureaus in accordance with the  Telecommuting Action Plan.  
Both parties agree to comply with this Plan, the provisions of which shall be superseded  by any modifications adopted by the Joint Labor/Management Committee on Employee  Parking and Transportation Options, or other body so authorized to make such  modifications.  
ARTICLE 5.0 WORK SCHEDULES  
ARTICLE 5.1 ALTERNATIVE WORK SCHEDULES  
Pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), employees shall have a fixed workweek  that consists of a regular recurring period of 168 consecutive hours (seven 24-hour  periods) which can begin and end on any day of the week and at any time of the day. The  designated workweek for an employee may be changed only if the change is intended to  be permanent and not designed to evade overtime requirements of the FLSA.  Management may assign employees to work a four/ten (4/10), five/forty (5/40),  nine/eighty (9/80), or other work schedule. The Association will be entitled to consult with  Management on the matter prior to the proposed action. The Association will also be  entitled, upon request, to consult with Management if Management intends to deny a  change in schedule to an employee. Management may require employees to change their  work schedules (working hours or change days off, except the split day) within the same 
24  
MOU01-22  
FLSA work week, providing that the change is not arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory.  In the event Management’s actions are shown to be arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory  before an arbitrator, the award of the arbitrator shall be to reverse the action of  Management. However, the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding or advisory in  accordance with Article 3.1. No employee shall be required to work a 4/10 schedule  against their will.  
It is further agreed that Management shall retain the right to refuse an employee's request  to work a 4/10, 9/80, or other work schedule, and to require the reversion to a 5/40 work  schedule, provided that the exercise of such right is not arbitrary, capricious, or  discriminatory. In the event Management's actions are shown to be arbitrary, capricious,  or discriminatory before an arbitrator, the award of the arbitrator shall be to reverse the  action of Management. However, the decision of the arbitrator shall be binding or  advisory, in accordance with Article 3.1.  
Employees on a 9/80 modified work schedule shall have designated a regular day off  (also known as 9/80 day off) which shall remain fixed. Temporary changes to the  designated 9/80 day off at the request of Management or the employee are prohibited  unless it is intended for the employee to work additional hours (overtime).  
Employees on a 4/10 work schedule shall work 10 hours per day for a four day work week  (or 12 hours per day for a three day work week in the Information Technology Agency  only) exclusive of lunch periods. Employees shall be entitled to rest periods in accordance  with the provisions of Article 4.4. Employees shall be compensated for 40 hours per week  at the regular hourly rate for their class and pay grade.  
EAA agrees that it is a management right to require employees who work on a 4/10, 9/80,  or 3/12 work schedule to work overtime on Saturday rather than on their day off which  falls within the week. Employees who work on a schedule other than 5/40 shall have their  sick leave, vacation and holiday credits accrued at the same hourly rate as an employee  on the 5/40 schedule.  
The City reserves the right to develop 26-week/1,040 hours or 52-week/2,080 hours work  periods under FLSA Section 7(b) [29 USC §207(b)(1) and (2)] during the term of this MOU  for the purpose of increasing scheduling flexibility. Implementation of this work schedule  is subject to agreement by the parties and certification of the Association as bona fide by  the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  
ARTICLE 5.2 DEPLOYMENT PERIOD (POLICE DEPARTMENT)  
Notwithstanding the provisions of LAAC Sections 4.108 (Regular Hours of Work) and  4.113 (Overtime) to the contrary, employees in this Unit who are employed in the Police  Department shall have a work schedule consisting of 20 days of work in each 28 day  deployment period. Such day may be eight, seven and one-half, or seven hours as  determined by the Chief of Police. 
25  
MOU01-22  
Said 20 days of work or the equivalent number of days for an alternate work schedule  may be scheduled at such time during two biweekly pay periods as the Chief of Police  may direct.  
This Article shall not be construed to prohibit the implementation of flexible work  schedules.  
ARTICLE 5.3 72 – HOUR WORK SCHEDULE  
Notwithstanding LAAC Section 4.108(a), whenever a full-time employee voluntarily  reduces the number of their biweekly regular work hours from 80 to a number not less  than 72 at the request of, or with the permission of, their appointing authority, such  employee shall be credited with all rights and benefits as though he/she worked 80 hours  in the payroll period. The employee shall not be credited for overtime worked until more  than 40 hours have been worked in the workweek. Compensation received under this  Article shall be considered full compensation for all employees participating in the  voluntary work hour reduction program.  
ARTICLE 6.0 COMPENSATION  
ARTICLE 6.1 SALARIES  
The parties to this MOU jointly recommend to the City Council approval of the salaries  set forth in the attached Salary Appendices. Effective July 7, 2019, Appendix C will  represent a conversion of the 15-Step salary range program to a 12-Step salary range  program for employees in this Unit.

ARTICLE 6.2 OVERTIME  
Section I – Distribution of Overtime  
Management will attempt to assign overtime work as equitably as possible among all  qualified employees in the same classification, in the same organizational unit and work  location. However, Management may consider special skills required to perform particular  work. No employee shall work overtime without prior approval from his or her supervisor.  FLSA non-exempt employees may not work outside of scheduled working hours, or  during unpaid meal periods, without the prior approval of a supervisor, consistent with  department policy. Failure to secure prior approval may result in discipline. Working and  not recording the time is similarly prohibited.  
Section II – Non-emergency Overtime  
Whenever Management deems it necessary to perform non-emergency work on an  overtime basis, employees required to work will be given at least 48 hours notice.  
Section III – Rate and Method of Compensation – FLSA Non-Exempt Employees  
Effective the first full pay period following City Council adoption, compensation for  overtime worked by employees in classifications listed in the Appendices, herein, shall be  for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek including all absences with pay  authorized by law. Management shall have the discretion to determine whether overtime  compensation shall be in cash or time-off. Overtime compensation shall be in time off at 
28  
MOU01-22  
the rate of one and one-half (1½) hours for each hour of overtime worked or at the rate of  one and one-half (1½) times the employee's regular rate of pay. 
Section IV – Compensated Time Off  
Employees may, subject to Management discretion, be permitted to accumulate up to 80  hours of compensatory time off (CTO). Occasionally, employees may accumulate CTO  in excess of 80 hours for a temporary period of time, not to exceed an additional fiscal  year. If an employee does not schedule and take CTO over 80 hours prior to the end of  the fiscal year, Management may require employees to use CTO prior to the end of the  fiscal year; require employees to use such time in lieu of vacation (unless the mandatory  use of CTO would result in the loss of vacation accumulation) or other leave time; or  authorize cash payment. In the event sufficient funds are not available to provide cash  compensation for all or a portion of the CTO hours in excess of 80, Management may  extend the time limit for a period not to exceed one additional fiscal year.  
In accordance with FLSA, no employee shall lose CTO. An employee who has requested  the use of CTO must be permitted by Management to use such time within a reasonable  time period after making the request unless the use of the CTO within a reasonable period  would unduly disrupt the operations of the City department. This standard does not apply  to non-FLSA overtime (i.e., overtime earned pursuant to this agreement that does not  meet the FLSA definition of overtime).  
Under no circumstances shall compensated time off in excess of 240 hours be  accumulated.  
ARTICLE 6.3 SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL  
Notwithstanding the provisions of Note N of Schedule A of LAAC Section 4.61, any  employee, when required to work fifty percent (50%) or more of their time during their  regular shift on any one day between the hours of 5:00 P.M. and 8:00 A.M., shall receive  for each such day worked a non-pensionable “adds to pay” bonus of 5.5% calculated on  the employee’s hourly base rate or, when regularly assigned, a pensionable “adds to rate”  bonus of 5.5% calculated on the employee’s hourly base rate. The procedure for the  payment of adjusted compensation for work performed under the provisions of this Article  shall be in accordance with LAAC Sections 4.72, 4.74, and 4.75. 
ARTICLE 6.4 BILINGUAL BONUS  
Whenever an appointing authority determines that it is necessary or desirable that a  position be filled by a person able to converse fluently in a language other than English,  or write and interpret a language other than English, the appointing authority shall transmit  to the Controller written authorization approving payment of a bilingual premium, as  provided by this Article to the person occupying such a position and possessing such  bilingual skills. 
29  
MOU01-22  
After authorizing payment of a bilingual premium, the appointing authority shall certify to  the Controller the name of an employee eligible for a bilingual premium and the Personnel  Department shall certify to the Controller that the employee has qualified under its  standards of fluency and proficiency for said language.  
Persons certified as being qualified by the Personnel Department shall receive a bilingual  bonus of $100.00 per biweekly pay period for duties requiring conversing fluently in a  language other than English, or $200.00 per biweekly pay period for duties requiring  conversing fluently and interpreting a language other than English. The bilingual premium  payment is pensionable when regularly assigned.  
For newly hired employees or employees newly appointed to a bilingual position, the  premium shall be paid at the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period once the  employee has been certified by the Personnel Department.  
ARTICLE 6.5 SIGN LANGUAGE PREMIUM  
Any qualified Unit employee who is requested by the hearing impaired assistance center  to utilize sign language shall receive compensation equal to two and three-quarter percent  (2.75%) of their salary or wages for each business day the skill is utilized. Such practices  of additional compensation shall be in accordance with LAAC Section 4.84.1.  
ARTICLE 6.6 COURT APPEARANCES  
Section I  
The following court provisions will apply to all employees in the Unit, except those  in the Police Department.  
When an employee is required to appear in Court in and for the County of Los Angeles  outside of their normal duty hours, but on a matter arising within the scope of their  employment, said employee shall be entitled to receive a minimum of one hour at one  and one-half (1½) times their regular rate of pay. Time spent in excess of the one hour  minimum guarantee shall also be at the rate of one and one-half (1½) times the  employee's regular rate of pay, payable in six minute increments. No compensation shall  be paid for the first 45 minutes of the Court's noon recess, provided, however, that no  such compensation shall be allowed unless such employee is in actual attendance in  court.  
Such compensation for court appearances may be in either time off or cash. Call back  provisions are not applicable to court appearances.  
 
30  
MOU01-22  
Section II  
The following court provisions shall apply to employees in the Police Department  only. 
These provisions apply only for the payment of overtime for court appearances outside  of the normal duty hours of employees. Call back provisions are not applicable to court  appearances.

An employee, at the employee's option, may report to court when subpoenaed or  remain on call. If the employee elects to appear in court, the division supervisor  must be notified, at the latest, one administrative day prior to the scheduled court  appearance. If the employee wishes to remain on call, the employee must be able  to appear in court not more than one hour after being notified that the employee's  appearance is required in court. To appear in court more than an hour after having  been notified will void the employee's right to on-call compensation. An employee  need not remain at home, but must be available for telephonic notification at a  location where the supervisor knows the employee can be reached.  
1. An off-duty employee shall receive a minimum of two hours overtime  compensation for any court day they are subpoenaed to be on call or  required to appear.  
2. An off-duty employee shall receive hour-for-hour overtime compensation for  each additional hour of actual attendance in excess of the two hour  minimum provided for in paragraph A.1. above, with the following noontime  recess exceptions:

45 minutes or less None  
46 minutes or more All time over 46 minutes

Note: An employee shall not receive court on-call overtime compensation and hour-for hour overtime compensation for the same time period.  
B. Multiple Cases  
An off-duty employee who receives morning and afternoon subpoenas for separate  cases on a court day shall receive overtime compensation as in paragraph A.1.  above, for each case for a total of four hours. In addition, he/she shall receive hour for-hour overtime compensation for each additional hour of actual court attendance  in excess of two hours. 
31  
MOU01-22  
C. Exceptions to the Two Hour Minimum  
Management will attempt to adjust an employee's shift to accommodate court  appearances or on-call status commencing two hours or less before or after the  employee's regularly assigned shift begins or ends. If an employee's shift cannot  be adjusted, the employee will be compensated as follows:  
1. Court appearances or on-call status commencing two hours or less before  the employee's regularly assigned shift begins. Compensation will be for  the actual time between the commencement of the court appearance or on call and the beginning of the employee's assigned shift with the same noon  recess provisions as outlined in paragraph A.2. above.  
2. Court appearances commencing two hours or less after the employee's  regularly assigned shift ends.

An employee duly summoned to attend any court for the purpose of performing  jury service shall, for those days during which jury service is actually performed  and those days necessary to qualify for jury service, receive their regular salary.  The absence of the employee for the purpose of performing jury service shall be 
32  
MOU01-22  
deemed to be an authorized absence with pay within the meaning of LAAC Section  4.75.  
B. During the time the employee is actually reporting for jury service, the head of the  department, office, or bureau, or their designee will convert the employee's usual  shift to a regular five-day, Monday through Friday day shift. However, employees  may choose to remain on an alternative work schedule (9/80, 4/10, or 3/12) or on  an off-watch schedule during jury service with the understanding that jury service  on a regularly scheduled day off (RDO) will not be compensated. Employees must  report for work on any day of their converted shift that they are not required by the  Court to perform jury service.

In lieu of the orders, the employee shall  furnish to the appointing authority, upon forms provided by the Controller, certified  evidence of their entry into active service in the armed forces of the United States and the  date thereof. Any certification required by this Article may be made by any authorized  officer of such armed forces. The City Controller shall have power at any time to require  such additional satisfactory evidence of the entry of such employee into active service in  such armed forces and of the actual performance by the employee of ordered military  duty during all or any part of such leave.  
In determining whether an employee has been in the service of the City for a period of  not less than one year immediately prior to the date on which the absence begins,  continuous service shall be required.

Section II  
Whenever an employee in the Police Department is ordered by a designated  representative of the Chief of Police to return to duty following the termination of the  employee's normal work shift and departure from the work location, the employee shall  receive the sum of ten dollars ($10.00) if the call is canceled prior to the time the employee  reports to the telephonically/electronically assigned work location.

Paid leave time  taken during a qualifying period shall extend the 10 day qualifying period by the  length of the absence. All other absences shall constitute a disqualifying break in  the 10 day qualifying period requirement, necessitating the initiation and  completion of a new qualifying period.

Half-time employees who, prior to  July 1, 1990, were receiving the full employee-only subsidy shall continue to  receive the full employee-only subsidy.  
D. Any employee who was receiving a full employee-only dental subsidy as of  July 1, 1990, in accordance with this Article, who transfers to half-time status  following that date shall continue to be eligible for the full subsidy. This provision  shall apply providing that such employee does not have a break in service  subsequent to July 1, 1990. Any half-time employee with a break in service after  July 1, 1990 shall be subject to the partial subsidy provisions in this Article.  
E. Further, any half-time employee receiving either a full or partial subsidy in  accordance with this Article who, subsequent to July 1, 1990, becomes an  intermittent employee shall not be eligible for such subsidy, notwithstanding their  status as a member of LACERS.  
F. During the term of this MOU, the JLMBC will review all rate changes and their  impact on the Dental Plans.  
Section III – Association-Sponsored Dental Insurance  
Employees may elect to be covered by one of the Association-sponsored dental  insurance programs instead of by the City-sponsored dental insurance plan. The amount  to be remitted for each employee covered by an Association sponsored plan shall be a  maximum of forty-nine dollars and eighty-four cents ($49.84) monthly. Enrollment in the  Association plans shall be available to all employees regardless of Association  membership or affiliation. Employees may not receive a subsidy for more than one of the  City-sponsored or Association-sponsored dental plans. 
40  
MOU01-22  
The parties mutually understand that the City will expend the above noted funds only for  those employees who enroll in these plans and remain on active payroll status with the  City, and that the City retains all rights to any unused funds which may be allocated for  the purpose of implementing this Article.  
The parties mutually understand that the City will provide to the separate EAA dental  carrier(s) an aggregate amount equal to the sum of the subsidy paid for those employees  enrolled in the Association-sponsored programs who are on the payroll during each  payroll period for which the subsidy is paid, together with a list of those employees for  whom the subsidy was paid during said payroll period. Remittance of this aggregate  amount will be made within 30 working days after the conclusion of the payroll period in  which the subsidy was paid.  
The parties further understand that for those employees enrolled in an Association sponsored program, who authorized the City Controller to make a payroll deduction to  cover any additional costs of said dental insurance plan, the City will remit to the carrier  a separate amount and appropriate deduction list.  
The parties mutually agree that the City is not responsible for, nor expected to provide,  any additional accounting, administrative, bookkeeping, and clerical or other services  except as provided for in the above paragraphs, and that the Association assumes all  responsibility for any services which may arise out of the administration of the  Association-sponsored programs.  
The Association shall indemnify, defend and hold the City harmless against any and all  claims, demands, suits or other forms of liability that shall arise out of or result from any  action taken by the City for purposes of complying with this Article, or by failure of the  Association or its dental insurance carrier to provide the coverage and services agreed  to between the Association and the carrier.  
Management will retain all duties and responsibilities it has had for the administration of  the City's Dental Plan.  
Section IV - Definition of Dependents  
The definition of a dependent for health and dental plan coverage shall include the  domestic partner of an employee and the dependents of such domestic partner. Any  employee claiming a domestic partner and/or the dependents of such domestic partner  for purposes of this Article shall have an approved City Affidavit of Domestic Partnership  form or a registered State of California Declaration of Domestic Partnership form on file  in the Employee Benefits Office, Personnel Department, which identifies that individual  as the employee’s domestic partner.

Section V - General Provisions  
A. An open enrollment period of at least 30 days shall be declared by the Personnel  Department. During this open period, employees may enroll themselves and, at  their option, their dependents in the City-sponsored plan.

However, employees may enroll in Association-sponsored  programs in accordance with the procedures of those programs.  
B. Management will retain all duties and responsibilities it has had for the  administration of the City’s Health and Dental Plans.

Employees shall be eligible for such continued subsidies while on a Family or  Medical Leave in accordance with Article 7.8 herein. However, for any unpaid portion of  Family or Medical Leave, health and/or dental plan subsidies shall be continued for a  maximum of nine pay periods, except while an employee is on a Pregnancy Disability  Leave absence (up to four months), Management shall continue the City’s subsidy for her  pregnancy health coverage (medical plan subsidy) in compliance with the provisions of  Government Code Section 12945 enacted in 2011.

Effective July 1, 2011, for all Tier I employees regardless of their date of  hire, the Tier I retirement formula and a flat-rated employee retirement  contribution of seven percent (7%) was implemented and shall be continued. The employee retirement contribution rate shall return to six  percent (6%) in accordance with LAAC Section 4.1033, which provides that  this seven percent (7%) employee retirement contribution will continue until 
42  
MOU01-22  
June 30, 2026, or until the ERIP cost obligation is fully paid, whichever  comes first.  
2. For employees hired on or after March 21, 2016, (the day that the City  Council adopted the Ordinance implementing LACERS Tier 3), the  retirement formula for LACERS Tier 3 is a flat-rated employee retirement  contribution of seven percent (7%) and shall be continued during the term  of the MOU.  
B. Retiree Health Benefits  
1. There is currently in effect a retiree health benefit program for retired  members of LACERS under LAAC Division 4, Chapter 11. All covered  employees who are members of LACERS, regardless of retirement tier,  shall contribute to LACERS four percent (4%) of their pre-tax compensation  earnable toward vested retiree health benefits as provided by this program.  The retiree health benefit available under this program is a vested benefit  for all covered employees who make this contribution, including employees  enrolled in LACERS Tier 3.  
2. With regard to LACERS Tier 1, as provided by LAAC Section 4.1111, the  monthly Maximum Medical Plan Premium Subsidy, which represents the  Kaiser 2-party non-Medicare Part A and Part B premium, is vested for all  members who made the additional contributions authorized by LAAC  Section 4.1003(c).  
3. Additionally, with regard to Tier 1 members who made the additional  contribution authorized by LAAC Section 4.1003(c), the maximum amount  of the annual increase authorized in LAAC Section 4.1111(b) is a vested  benefit that shall be granted by the LACERS Board.  
4. With regard to LACERS Tier 3, the Implementing Ordinance shall provide  that all Tier 3 members shall contribute to LACERS four percent (4%) of  their pre-tax compensation earnable toward vested retiree health benefits,  and shall amend LAAC Division 4, Chapter 11 to provide the same vested  benefits to all Tier 3 members as currently are provided to Tier 1 members  who make the same four percent (4%) contribution to LACERS under the  retiree health benefit program.  
5. The entitlement to retiree health benefits under this provision shall be  subject to the rules under LAAC Division 4, Chapter 11 in effect as of the  effective date of this provision, and the rules that shall be placed into LAAC  Division 4, Chapters 10 and 11, with regard to Tier 3, by the Implementing  Ordinance.

8. Employees whose Health Service Credit, as defined in LAAC Division 4,  Chapter 11, is based on periods of part-time and less than full-time  employment, shall receive full, rather than prorated, Health Service Credit  for periods of service. The monthly retiree medical subsidy amount to which  these employees are entitled shall be prorated based on the extent to which  their service credit is prorated due to their less than full time status.  
C. Procedure for Benefits Modifications  
1. Proposals for major retirement benefit modifications will be negotiated in  joint meetings with the certified employee organizations whose  memberships will be directly affected. Agreements reached between  Management and organizations whereby a majority of the members in  LACERS are affected shall be recommended to the City Council by the CAO  as affecting the membership of all employees in LACERS. Such  modifications need not be included in the MOU in order to be considered  appropriately negotiated.  
2. Proposals for minor benefit modifications and technical changes will be  considered and reported on as appropriate, but no more than once a year,  in a report from the CAO to the City Council. Affected organizations shall be  given the opportunity to review the proposed minor changes prior to the  release of the report, and their views shall be included in the report.  
3. If agreement is not reached between Management and the organizations  representing a majority of the members in LACERS as to whether a  particular proposal constitutes either a major or a minor modification, the  proposal shall be treated as a major modification.  
ARTICLE 7.3 SICK LEAVE BENEFITS

b. Beginning the January 1 subsequent to the completion of 12  calendar months of employment following their date of hire, half-time  employees shall be provided prorated sick leave hours based on the  calendar year sick leave allotment for full-time employees of 96 hours  at 100% of full pay and 40 hours at 75% of full pay, plus the hours of  sick leave accrued and accumulated as provided in this Article. The  prorated amount of 100% and 75% sick leave hours for half-time  employees will be calculated on the basis of the total number of  hours compensated in the previous 12-month calendar period  (January 1 through December 31) in relationship to the total number  of hours required for full-time employment.  
c. Any unused balance of sick leave at 100% of full pay at the end of  any calendar year shall be carried over and accumulated from one  (1) calendar year to the next up to a maximum of 800 hours.

e. If a half-time employee separates from City service and is rehired by  the City within one (1) year from the date of separation, previously  accrued and unused sick leave shall be reinstated.  
3. Intermittent Employees  
a. Intermittent employees, as defined by Section 4.110(b) of the LAAC,  shall begin accruing sick leave on the first day of employment.

Section III – Active Military Service: Vacation Accrual during Leave and Cash-Out of  Accrued Vacation at Commencement of Leave  
Employees called into active military service (other than temporary military service) shall,  following their qualifying year of service for vacation, continue to accrue vacation during  their military service, subject to the same maximum accrual requirements as active City  employees. To avoid reaching maximum accrual during an extended leave, employees  may request cash payment of accrued, but unused vacation time as of the date of the  commencement of their military leave. Such request may be for all accrued time or a  portion of their accrued time. The request for any cash payment must be made prior to  the employee’s first day of their leave of absence. Military orders or other evidence of  call-up into the armed forces of the United States must be submitted with the request.  
ARTICLE 7.7 BEREAVEMENT LEAVE  
An employee who is absent from work by reason of the death of a member of their  immediate family shall, upon the approval of the appointing authority or the agent thereof  designated to determine such matters, be allowed a leave of absence with full pay for a  maximum of three working days for each occurrence of a death in the employee's  immediate family. Such employees shall furnish a death certificate or other satisfactory  proof of the death to justify the absence.  
"Immediate family" shall include the father, mother, brother, sister, spouse, child,  grandparents, grandchildren, step-parents, father-in-law, mother-in-law, step-children,  foster child, the domestic partner of an employee, and the child of a domestic partner or  a household member (any person residing in the immediate household of the employee  at the time of the illness or injury).  
For the purpose of this Article, simultaneous, multiple family deaths will be considered as  one occurrence.  
Bereavement Leave may be taken during a period of up to 370 calendar days after the  occurrence.  
Any employee claiming a domestic partner for purposes of this Section shall complete a  confidential affidavit to be filed in the Employee Benefits Office, Personnel Department,  which shall be signed by the City employee only, declaring the existence of a domestic  partnership with a named domestic partner. No affidavit is required to secure  bereavement leave benefits arising from the death of a household member (any person  residing in the immediate household of the employee at the time of death). By extending  to an employee the specific benefits defined by this Section, the City does not intend to  confer or imply any other unspecified benefits to such employee, or to the employee's  domestic partner, or to the employee's household members, or to any other person.  
In addition to the bereavement leave granted under this Article, upon the approval of the  appointing authority, any employee who has accrued unused sick leave at full pay, shall 
52  
MOU01-22  
be allowed sick leave with full pay not to exceed two working days per occurrence for the  purpose of bereavement leave if it is necessary for the employee to travel a minimum of  1,500 miles one way, as calculated by the Automobile Association of America (AAA).

Employees (each parent individually) are also eligible for family leave  (bonding) under the California Family Rights Act, which shall be limited to  four months (nine [9] pay periods) and must be concluded within one year  of the child’s birth. Whereas bonding leave for the pregnant employee may  be taken before or after delivery, bonding leave for the non-pregnant  employee shall be taken on or after the anticipated delivery or placement  date of the child except as may be necessary under Subsection D.2.  “Adoption”.

Management may require the employee to transfer temporarily  to an available alternative position with equivalent compensation for which  the employee is qualified that accommodates recurring periods of leave  better than the employee’s regular position. Employees who elect a part 
time schedule shall receive prorated compensated time off benefits in  accordance with LAAC Section 4.110 during the duration of their part-time  schedule.

This benefit may be used in no less than one-hour increments  for the following:  
1. Personal business, subject to approval of the supervisor;  
2. Holidays assigned off.  
When a holiday falls on an employee’s assigned schedule and the employee is not  required to work on that holiday, an employee may request to use CPTO. If the qualifying  employee chooses not to use CPTO for the holiday, the employee may be allowed,  subject to the approval of the supervisor, to adjust their work schedule and make up the  time in full not later than the next succeeding payroll period. 
CPTO may be accumulated for up to a maximum of 48 hours. Any time accumulated in  excess of such amount shall be deemed waived and lost. Intermittent employees with  accrued CPTO and/or 100% sick leave hours, who become full-time or half-time 
62

employees, shall be allowed to carry over into their 100% sick leave bank a maximum of  48 hours of unused CPTO, 100% sick leave, or any combination of such unused time.  Any unused CPTO and/or sick leave in excess of the 48 hours carried over shall be  deemed waived and lost. There shall be no payment of any form for unused personal time  upon separation from City service for any reason.  
Employees who hold more than one intermittent position concurrently shall be eligible to  accrue CPTO in only one position. Employees should designate a primary employing  department in writing with their primary and secondary employing departments and with  the Controller’s Office. If an employee fails to designate a primary employing department,  the Controller’s Office will designate the first department to hire the employee as the  primary employing department. Employees may change their designated primary  department during the Open Enrollment period of October 1 – 31. If an employee changes  departments outside the Open Enrollment period, the Controller’s Office will designate  the first department to hire the employee as the primary employing department, unless  the employee notifies the Controller’s Office otherwise within 30 calendar days of the  effective date of the change. Employees who are paid per diem or by the session shall  not be eligible to accrue CPTO.
