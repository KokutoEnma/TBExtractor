<title>ARTICLE 6.2 OVERTIME</title>
<subtitle>Section I – Distribution of Overtime</subtitle>
<body>Management will attempt to assign overtime work as equitably as possible among all
qualified employees in the same classification, in the same organizational unit and work
location. However, Management may consider special skills required to perform particular
work. No employee shall work overtime without prior approval from his or her supervisor.
FLSA non-exempt employees may not work outside of scheduled working hours, or
during unpaid meal periods, without the prior approval of a supervisor, consistent with
department policy. Failure to secure prior approval may result in discipline. Working and
not recording the time is similarly prohibited.</body>
<subtitle>Section II – Non-emergency Overtime</subtitle>
<body>Whenever Management deems it necessary to perform non-emergency work on an
overtime basis, employees required to work will be given at least 48 hours notice.</body>
<subtitle>Section III – Rate and Method of Compensation – FLSA Non-Exempt Employees</subtitle>
<body>Effective the first full pay period following City Council adoption, compensation for
overtime worked by employees in classifications listed in the Appendices, herein, shall be
for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek including all absences with pay
authorized by law. Management shall have the discretion to determine whether overtime
compensation shall be in cash or time-off. Overtime compensation shall be in time off at
the rate of one and one-half (1½) hours for each hour of overtime worked or at the rate of
one and one-half (1½) times the employee's regular rate of pay.</body>
<subtitle>Section IV – Compensated Time Off</subtitle>
<body>Employees may, subject to Management discretion, be permitted to accumulate up to 80
hours of compensatory time off (CTO). Occasionally, employees may accumulate CTO
in excess of 80 hours for a temporary period of time, not to exceed an additional fiscal
year. If an employee does not schedule and take CTO over 80 hours prior to the end of
the fiscal year, Management may require employees to use CTO prior to the end of the
fiscal year; require employees to use such time in lieu of vacation (unless the mandatory
use of CTO would result in the loss of vacation accumulation) or other leave time; or
authorize cash payment. In the event sufficient funds are not available to provide cash
compensation for all or a portion of the CTO hours in excess of 80, Management may
extend the time limit for a period not to exceed one additional fiscal year.
In accordance with FLSA, no employee shall lose CTO. An employee who has requested
the use of CTO must be permitted by Management to use such time within a reasonable
time period after making the request unless the use of the CTO within a reasonable period
would unduly disrupt the operations of the City department. This standard does not apply
to non-FLSA overtime (i.e., overtime earned pursuant to this agreement that does not
meet the FLSA definition of overtime).
Under no circumstances shall compensated time off in excess of 240 hours be
accumulated.</body>
<title>ARTICLE 6.3 SHIFT DIFFERENTIAL</title>
<body>Notwithstanding the provisions of Note N of Schedule A of LAAC Section 4.61, any
employee, when required to work fifty percent (50%) or more of their time during their
regular shift on any one day between the hours of 5:00 P.M. and 8:00 A.M., shall receive
for each such day worked a non-pensionable “adds to pay” bonus of 5.5% calculated on
the employee’s hourly base rate or, when regularly assigned, a pensionable “adds to rate”
bonus of 5.5% calculated on the employee’s hourly base rate. The procedure for the
payment of adjusted compensation for work performed under the provisions of this Article
shall be in accordance with LAAC Sections 4.72, 4.74, and 4.75.</body>
<title>ARTICLE 6.4 BILINGUAL BONUS</title>
<body>Whenever an appointing authority determines that it is necessary or desirable that a
position be filled by a person able to converse fluently in a language other than English,
or write and interpret a language other than English, the appointing authority shall transmit
to the Controller written authorization approving payment of a bilingual premium, as
provided by this Article to the person occupying such a position and possessing such
bilingual skills.
After authorizing payment of a bilingual premium, the appointing authority shall certify to
the Controller the name of an employee eligible for a bilingual premium and the Personnel
Department shall certify to the Controller that the employee has qualified under its
standards of fluency and proficiency for said language.
Persons certified as being qualified by the Personnel Department shall receive a bilingual
bonus of $100.00 per biweekly pay period for duties requiring conversing fluently in a
language other than English, or $200.00 per biweekly pay period for duties requiring
conversing fluently and interpreting a language other than English. The bilingual premium
payment is pensionable when regularly assigned.
For newly hired employees or employees newly appointed to a bilingual position, the
premium shall be paid at the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period once the
employee has been certified by the Personnel Department.</body>
<title>ARTICLE 6.5 SIGN LANGUAGE PREMIUM</title>
<body>Any qualified Unit employee who is requested by the hearing impaired assistance center
to utilize sign language shall receive compensation equal to two and three-quarter percent
(2.75%) of their salary or wages for each business day the skill is utilized. Such practices
of additional compensation shall be in accordance with LAAC Section 4.84.1.</body>
<title>ARTICLE 6.6 COURT APPEARANCES</title>
<subtitle>Section I</subtitle>
<body>The following court provisions will apply to all employees in the Unit, except those
in the Police Department.
When an employee is required to appear in Court in and for the County of Los Angeles
outside of their normal duty hours, but on a matter arising within the scope of their
employment, said employee shall be entitled to receive a minimum of one hour at one
and one-half (1½) times their regular rate of pay. Time spent in excess of the one hour
minimum guarantee shall also be at the rate of one and one-half (1½) times the
employee's regular rate of pay, payable in six minute increments. No compensation shall
be paid for the first 45 minutes of the Court's noon recess, provided, however, that no
such compensation shall be allowed unless such employee is in actual attendance in
court.
Such compensation for court appearances may be in either time off or cash. Call back
provisions are not applicable to court appearances.</body>
<subtitle>Section II</subtitle>
<body>The following court provisions shall apply to employees in the Police Department
only.
These provisions apply only for the payment of overtime for court appearances outside
of the normal duty hours of employees. Call back provisions are not applicable to court
appearances.
A. Basic Compensation
An employee, at the employee's option, may report to court when subpoenaed or
remain on call. If the employee elects to appear in court, the division supervisor
must be notified, at the latest, one administrative day prior to the scheduled court
appearance. If the employee wishes to remain on call, the employee must be able
to appear in court not more than one hour after being notified that the employee's
appearance is required in court. To appear in court more than an hour after having
been notified will void the employee's right to on-call compensation. An employee
need not remain at home, but must be available for telephonic notification at a
location where the supervisor knows the employee can be reached.
1. An off-duty employee shall receive a minimum of two hours overtime
compensation for any court day they are subpoenaed to be on call or
required to appear.
2. An off-duty employee shall receive hour-for-hour overtime compensation for
each additional hour of actual attendance in excess of the two hour
minimum provided for in paragraph A.1. above, with the following noontime
recess exceptions:
Length of Recess Amount of Compensation
45 minutes or less None
46 minutes or more All time over 46 minutes
(in 6 minute increments).
Note: An employee shall not receive court on-call overtime compensation and hour-for-
hour overtime compensation for the same time period.
B. Multiple Cases
An off-duty employee who receives morning and afternoon subpoenas for separate
cases on a court day shall receive overtime compensation as in paragraph A.1.
above, for each case for a total of four hours. In addition, he/she shall receive hour-
for-hour overtime compensation for each additional hour of actual court attendance
in excess of two hours.
C. Exceptions to the Two Hour Minimum
Management will attempt to adjust an employee's shift to accommodate court
appearances or on-call status commencing two hours or less before or after the
employee's regularly assigned shift begins or ends. If an employee's shift cannot
be adjusted, the employee will be compensated as follows:
1. Court appearances or on-call status commencing two hours or less before
the employee's regularly assigned shift begins. Compensation will be for
the actual time between the commencement of the court appearance or on-
call and the beginning of the employee's assigned shift with the same noon
recess provisions as outlined in paragraph A.2. above.
2. Court appearances commencing two hours or less after the employee's
regularly assigned shift ends. Compensation will be for the actual time
between the end of the employee's assigned shift and the termination of the
court appearance with the same noon recess provisions as outlined in
paragraph A.2. above.
3. Court appearances or on-call that begins during an employee’s regularly
assigned shift. Compensation will be for the actual time between the end of
the employee's assigned shift and the termination of the appearance or on-
call status with the same noon recess provisions as outlined in paragraph
A.2. above.</body>
<title>ARTICLE 6.7 CIVIC DUTY</title>
<body>Whenever an employee is served with a subpoena by a court of competent jurisdiction
which compels their presence as a witness during their normal working period, unless
they are a party to the litigation or an expert witness, such employee shall be granted time
off with pay in the amount of the difference between the employee's regular earnings and
any amount he/she receives for such appearance. This Article is not applicable to
appearances for which the employee receives compensation in excess of their regular
earnings.
A court of competent jurisdiction is defined as a court within the County in which the
employee resides or if outside the county of residence, the place of appearance must be
within 150 miles of the employee's residence.</body>
<title>ARTICLE 6.8 JURY SERVICE</title>
<body>A. An employee duly summoned to attend any court for the purpose of performing
jury service shall, for those days during which jury service is actually performed
and those days necessary to qualify for jury service, receive their regular salary.
The absence of the employee for the purpose of performing jury service shall be
deemed to be an authorized absence with pay within the meaning of LAAC Section
4.75.
B. During the time the employee is actually reporting for jury service, the head of the
department, office, or bureau, or their designee will convert the employee's usual
shift to a regular five-day, Monday through Friday day shift. However, employees
may choose to remain on an alternative work schedule (9/80, 4/10, or 3/12) or on
an off-watch schedule during jury service with the understanding that jury service
on a regularly scheduled day off (RDO) will not be compensated. Employees must
report for work on any day of their converted shift that they are not required by the
Court to perform jury service.
C. Compensation for mileage paid by the courts for jury service shall be retained by
the employee.
D. Employees performing jury service on a designated City holiday shall be
compensated for the designated City holiday; additional time off for that holiday
shall not be provided.

purpose of performing jury service shall, for those days during which jury service
is actually performed and those days necessary to qualify for jury service, receive
their regular salary.</body>

<body>Every employee who qualifies for and is granted a military leave, whether temporary or
otherwise, pursuant to the provisions of the Military and Veterans Code of the State of
California, shall, before they are paid their salary or compensation during such leave, or
any part thereof, as provided in said Code, furnish to their appointing authority two
certified copies of their orders, one copy to be filed in the department in which they are
employed and the other with the Controller. In lieu of the orders, the employee shall
furnish to the appointing authority, upon forms provided by the Controller, certified
evidence of their entry into active service in the armed forces of the United States and the
date thereof. Any certification required by this Article may be made by any authorized
officer of such armed forces. The City Controller shall have power at any time to require
such additional satisfactory evidence of the entry of such employee into active service in
such armed forces and of the actual performance by the employee of ordered military
duty during all or any part of such leave.
In determining whether an employee has been in the service of the City for a period of
not less than one year immediately prior to the date on which the absence begins,
continuous service shall be required.
Employees called into active military service (other than temporary military leave) shall
accrue vacation time, and be entitled to the cash-out of accrued, but unused vacation
time, in accordance with Article 7.6, Vacation, Section II of this MOU.</body>
<title>ARTICLE 6.10 MILEAGE</title>
<body>Each employee that is authorized to use their own vehicle, pursuant to LAAC Division 4,
Chapter 5, Article 2, in the performance of their duties shall be reimbursed for
transportation expenses at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rate established on
January 1st of each calendar year or at subsequent times during the calendar year for all
miles traveled in any biweekly period, in addition to any and all salaries and other
compensation otherwise provided for by law.
Notwithstanding LAAC Section 4.231, employees authorized to use their personal
vehicles pursuant to LAAC Section 4.229, who are required by Management to bring the
vehicle to work each day shall receive a minimum payment of 10 miles per day, regardless
of whether the vehicle is driven for City business. If an employee is not authorized or
required to bring a vehicle to work for use in the course of their work assignment, they will
no longer be provided a minimum payment of 10 miles per day.
During the term of this MOU, the cents per mile reimbursement shall be adjusted to an
amount equal to the annual standard car mileage allowance as determined by the IRS.
The CAO shall certify to the Controller appropriate changes, if required, to become
effective at the beginning of the first full pay period in which the IRS reimbursement rate
change is effective.</body>

<body>Whenever an employee is ordered by the administrative head of their department, office
or bureau, or their designee to return to duty following the termination of their work shift
and departure from their work location, they shall receive minimum compensation
equivalent to four hours at their appropriate overtime rate. Call Back time contiguous to
and continuing into a normal work shift will not be treated as Call Back for purposes of
this Article, but will instead be compensated as hour for hour overtime.</body>
<subtitle>Section II</subtitle>
<body>Whenever an employee in the Police Department is ordered by a designated
representative of the Chief of Police to return to duty following the termination of the
employee's normal work shift and departure from the work location, the employee shall

personally, such employees shall receive a minimum of one hour of compensation,
subject to the following limitations:
1. Only the first disturbance call made in any one calendar day shall qualify for
the minimum one hour of compensation described above. The time actually
spent on such disturbance call will be considered hours worked for that

calls totaling an aggregate of ten minutes or more in that same calendar
day shall be for actual time worked. Disturbance call compensation shall be
used to offset any overtime owed.
2. Any employee receiving On-Call/Standby compensation for the same day

3. The department head or designee may determine the method of
compensation;
4. An employee contacted while off-duty concerning subsequent work
scheduling shall not be eligible to receive compensation under this Article.

according to the Disturbance Call article of this MOU.</body>
<title>ARTICLE 6.13 ON-CALL/STANDBY COMPENSATION</title>
<body>Any employee in this bargaining unit shall receive standby compensation at the rates

<subtitle>Section I – Temporary Supervisory Pay</subtitle>
<body>A. Whenever Management assigns an employee to perform the full duties of a higher
level supervisory position in situations where the incumbent of the higher level
position is temporarily absent, such employee shall become eligible for additional
compensation upon completion of a qualifying period of 10 consecutive working
days in such assignment at their regular rate of compensation. Paid leave time
taken during a qualifying period shall extend the 10 day qualifying period by the
length of the absence. All other absences shall constitute a disqualifying break in
the 10 day qualifying period requirement, necessitating the initiation and
completion of a new qualifying period. Pay shall begin on the 11th day of the
assignment.
Each temporary supervisory assignment shall require completion of a new
qualifying period each fiscal year, except when such assignment is continuous and
in the same work location.

assigned or on a daily basis, shall receive compensation at two (2) premium levels
(approximately 5.5%) pensionable when regularly assigned; non-pensionable
bonus when assigned on a daily basis.
B. The designation, re-designation or removal of a lead assignment shall be a
Management prerogative and may occur any time Management deems it
appropriate. Such Management decisions shall be final and conclusive and shall
not be subject to the grievance procedure herein. Nothing in this Section, however,
is intended to deny the premium payment specified herein to an employee who

position, meaning a full-time, regularly assigned supervisor with full administrative
and technical authority to assign, review, and approve work of his or her
subordinates, excluding either the general manager of any department, bureau, or
office of the City or their chief assistant. In the case where the civil service class

designee may consider working titles and tables of organization to determine
whether an employee is a chief assistant.
